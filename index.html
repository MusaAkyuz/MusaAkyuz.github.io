        It all started with the rocket adventure in high school. After
        <span class="orange">watching a video</span> of a rocket made using only
        <span class="orange">sugar</span> and
        <span class="orange">plant fertilizer</span>, there was almost a week
        between the rocket that <span class="orange">exploded</span> just 1
        meter away from us. We had managed to create a
        <span class="orange">large cloud</span> (fuel burning desperately on the
        ground), but we hadn’t been able to make a
        <span class="orange">long, thin cloud</span> (smoke trailing behind it
        while flying).

        I tried several attempts like 'Johnny Sixtyone Sixtyone Six' but I
        failed. Check my attempts from my channel and get back to laugh at me.

        Well... I don't know. I think I will start by researching places that
        sell model rocket engines, their prices, and the permits required to
        bring them into the country. Or, should I make the fuel myself? I'll
        research these options. Again!!!

      <p class="blue">-> Me</p>
      <p>
        I'm really <span class="orange">a bored engineer</span>, and I suddenly
        decided to start a project <span class="orange">again</span>. Yesterday,
        I bought a new checked notebook and fancy pens, all for a fresh start.
        Actually, I have <span class="orange">zillions</span> of checked
        notebooks and bilions of fancy pens for all the fresh starts of other
        projects which are <span class="orange">unfinished</span>. Anyway, these
        words already define me, but you should know I love
        <span class="orange">space</span> and
        <span class="orange">rockets</span>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="blue">-> Goal</p>
      <p>
        The Fart Project is a rocket project whose goal is to reach the
        <span class="orange">Kármán Line</span>. The Kármán Line is the boundary
        between <span class="orange">Earth's atmosphere</span> and
        <span class="orange">outer space</span>, located at an altitude of about
        <span class="orange">100 kilometers</span> (62 miles) above sea level.
        The side goal is to finish the project (hahaha) and share all the
        information I gained on this journey. Like the Kármán Line, which I
        <span class="orange">Googled 20 seconds ago</span>, I will share
        technical stuff, sources, books I’ve read, papers, people I’ve talked
        to, experiments... etc.

        The project name came from in me. After that, I thought about the
        <span class="orange">similarities between rockets and farts</span>. I
        found an incredibly similar point: both of them expel very hot gas from
        a hole at incredibly high speeds after some chemical reactions.
